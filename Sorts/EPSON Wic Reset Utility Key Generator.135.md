7. If any of the counters shows more than 100%, it means that your printer has reached its limit and needs to be reset.
8. To reset your waste ink counters, you need to buy a reset key from [https://www.wic.support/buy/](https://www.wic.support/buy/). You can pay by Visa, Master Card, PayPal, Webmoney or Western Union. The price of one reset key is $9.99 USD.
9. After you buy a reset key, you will receive an email with your key code. Enter your key code in the "Enter reset key here" box and click on "Reset waste counters" button. You will see a confirmation message like this:

11. Click on "OK" button and restart your printer. Your waste ink counters should be reset to zero and your printer should work normally again.

Note: You can use one reset key only for one printer. If you have more than one printer that needs to be reset, you need to buy more reset keys. You can also use a trial reset key to test if WIC Utility works for your printer. The trial reset key will reset your waste ink counters to 80% one time only. You can get a free trial reset key from [https://www.wic.support/trial-reset-key/](https://www.wic.support/trial-reset-key/).

WIC Utility is a useful tool that can help you fix your Epson printer and save money on buying new ink cartridges or a new printer. However, resetting your waste ink counters does not solve the problem of the waste ink pads being full. You still need to replace or clean the waste ink pads periodically to avoid ink leakage or damage to your printer. You can find more information about how to replace or clean the waste ink pads on [https://www.wic.support/how-to-replace-waste-ink-pads/](https://www.wic.support/how-to-replace-waste-ink-pads/).
